# 👋 Hi there! I'm Mamitiana Ratsimba

🎓 I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science student at [ITUniversity Andoharanofotsy](https://www.ituniversity-mg.com/page/licence-en-informatique/)

💡 Passionate about web development, tech, and system optimization.  
I love experimenting through personal projects, exploring modern frameworks, and solving problems methodically (often with a bit of guitar in the background 🎸).  
🎯 I mainly work on projects using Java, PHP, Vue.js — and more.

Currently looking for an **internship** — and open to professional opportunities.

📄 My resume is available upon request
